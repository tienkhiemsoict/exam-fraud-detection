# Output Directory

This directory will contain the processed videos with detection annotations.

## Files generated:
- `back_direction_detected.mp4` - Processed video from back camera
- `front_direction_detected.mp4` - Processed video from front camera

## Structure:
```
output/
├── back_direction_detected.mp4    # Generated by exam_detector_back.py
├── front_direction_detected.mp4   # Generated by exam_detector_front.py
└── reports/                       # Optional: Statistical reports
```

> **Note**: Output videos are automatically generated when you run the detection scripts. The original output files are ignored by git due to their large file sizes.
